	Long: `dnd-cli is a comprehensive tool designed to assist dungeon masters in managing their Dungeons & Dragons campaigns.
	
This CLI includes the following features:
- Dice Rolling: Roll standard dice types (e.g., 1d20, 2d6) with support for advanced options like percentage rolls and averages.
- Campaign Management: Create, list, update, and delete campaigns.
- Combat Tracker: Manage combat rounds, track initiative, and handle turn progression.
- Player Management: Add, remove, and list player characters.
- Inventory Management: Maintain a list of items, add and remove inventory for campaigns or players.

Each module is accessible through intuitive commands, making dnd-cli a powerful companion for any dungeon master.`,

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
